EIM
===

EIM (Event-Interest Model) is an agent-based model in which social networks are evolving driven by social events and individual interests. 
The model incorporates an intuitive idea: individuals begin to interact when participating in the same interest-based event, and the social ties are formed or reinforced between two individuals if they have similar interests and would like to link to each other.
